## About Docker

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate 
your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage 
your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s 
methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly 
reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
